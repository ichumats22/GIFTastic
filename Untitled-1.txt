Only the add an animal form and two empty divs (one for the buttons and one for the Gifs) are coded statically 

The buttons along the top of the page will be created dynamically using the "topics" array

When the user clicks a button, an AJAX function will run to get 10 related gifs using the Giphy API, which will be displayed as still images on the page along with their rating

Clicking a different button will remove the existing Gifs from the page and replace them with 10 static gifs related to the word clicked

When a user clicks submit to add an animal, run a function to stop the default form submission and instead add the user input to the "topics" array, create a button for it, and append the button to the page
